<!-- This file lists out the default locations to find additional configuration information.  This information isn't 
in the testharness-test-config.xml because we don't want maven to filter the file in here so we can conveniently add
${user.home} or whatever else System properties and get them runtime and not build time. Depends on 
${module.name} set by
1.)  Maven in the root config file of the module being tested
2.)  test harness
